                <h2>Week 2</h2>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> The first interaction that stood out on this page occured when I started to scroll down the site. Images began to move and little animations occured bringing the whole page to life but only in time with my scrolling.  </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> At first I scrolled all the way to bottom of the page, interested with the images and graphics happening across my screen. Once I reached the bottom I noticed that I could interact with a bin with a sign on it saying "Clean where there is no littering!" and clicked on it. It opened the bin to reveal some horns to which I also clicked on. A cute dragon statue with reflective sunglasses rose from the bin. Next I returned to the top of the page to see where the navigation bar at the top would take me. Quickly I realsied by clicking on each option and returning to try the next that it was simply a directory to sections on the page. So next I slowly scrolled through each section trying to see what else I could click on and reveal, while also taking a closer look reading all the propmpts and popups. By the end of the scrolling I found myself at the bottom of the page again with a newly found appreciation for janitors. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> By far the most engaging interaction was seeing the site come to life as I scrolled. Reading all the text bubbles and characters move around, back and forth as I scrolled up and down again like skipping around on a new song. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> Utilising the scroll wheel was the main feature of the site and hence was the most common action I made. It progressed the story the page was telling and provided new visuals to dance across my screen. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> I believe the main purpose of websites interaction was to simply keep scrolling. Keep learning and reading and seeing more about what the page had to say. To get to the solution of the addressed issue at the bottom and help convince those that made it to make a difference in their own day to day life and maybe checkout the social media links at the bottom. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> Fantastically. This interaction is so satisfying and simple that even without the educational content it provides it a super easy action with a fun reward. Each scrolling partaking in a unique visual consequence entices the reader to keep going and see what else will happen. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> Personally, I interacted FULLY with the experience around 2 to 3 times, each time taking more care into the actual content of the page rather than the visual interaction. This total experience should only take 2 to 3 minutes. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> Over the 2 to 3 minutes the reader while spend on the experience, the site does a great job communicated that scrolling and reading each point is the purpose of the site. As mentioned previously, each scroll is tied to a unique visual change bring the page to life and as you scroll, not only do you find out more about the sites information but experience more and more of the sites fun visual jounrey. </p>

            <section id="Week 3" class="sections">

                <h2>Week 3</h2>

                <p>&nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> This peice references a lot about the general news and news articles as well as link some phyiscal artworks and paintings to the relevant information across the page. There is also a small link to social media at the bottom. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> It shows that the bulk of the information and targeting is at how the public and especially the news treat the subject of the website. It is also highlights that text, the main information in news media, is the focus of the site. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> It encouraged me to go back and fully read the website in order to comprehend properly what the author was trying to get across. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> By far the most frustrating part of the interaction occured when I was looking back through the site for information or general reading. The fact that I have to scroll to a certain point to even be able to see some infortmation despite being in the right section was a little annoying. </p>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p1> <b>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </b> </p1>

                <p> &nbsp</p>

                <p> The scrolling was definitely the most satisfying part of the website interaction. I felt in control of site and its movements while also being guided on a visual journery and learning lots at the same time. The scrolling made want to keep scrolling and keep learning. </p>
